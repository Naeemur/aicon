# Aicon (আইকন)
My vector icon set containing over 700 icons. 

Most of these are my own design but there are some logos and some icons from other open-source icon sets.

See the list of icons. To use an icon add a classes .ic.ic-{icon-name} to an element. It's that simple.

There are also stylus variables for the icons.
